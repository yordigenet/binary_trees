# 0x1D. C - Binary trees

## Learning Objectives

General

- What is a binary tree
- What is the difference between a binary tree and a Binary Search Tree
- What is the possible gain in terms of time complexity compared to linked lists
- What are the depth, the height, the size of a binary tree
- What are the different traversal methods to go through a binary tree
- What is a complete, a full, a perfect, a balanced binary tree

## Requirements

- All files are created and compiled on Ubuntu 14.04.4 LTS on gcc 4.8.4 using the flags -Wall -Werror -Wextra and -pedantic
- All files are linted for syntax and style with [Betty](https://github.com/holbertonschool/Betty)

```c
/**
 * struct binary_tree_s - Binary tree node
 *
 * @n: Integer stored in the node
 * @parent: Pointer to the parent node
 * @left: Pointer to the left child node
 * @right: Pointer to the right child node
 */
struct binary_tree_s
{
    int n;
    struct binary_tree_s *parent;
    struct binary_tree_s *left;
    struct binary_tree_s *right;
};
typedef struct binary_tree_s binary_tree_t;
